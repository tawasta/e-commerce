========================================================
Processing payment text shown for unfinished transaction
========================================================

This text is shown normally for unfinished payment:
    "We are not able to find your payment, but don't worry.
    You should receive an email confirming your payment in a few minutes.
    If the payment hasn't been confirmed you can contact us."

This module replaces that text with a following text:
    "Your order is being processed."
